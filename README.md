# Autism_Learning_code_practice
Here I am working on Autism Prediction by using ML approaches. Dataset used here is extracted from RAMP autism prediction competition which includes both sMRI and fMRI dataset. Here, fMRI dataset is in time-series. Since, I am new to this environment, my codes are raw and more like practice code for using ML approaches. ClassifierM_anatomy includes both feature extractor and classifier for sMRI dataset. Classifier_fmri includes both feature extractor and classifier for fMRI dataset.
