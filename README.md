# Autism_Learning_code_practice
Here I am working on Autism Prediction by using ML approaches. Dataset used here is extracted from RAMP autism prediction competition which includes both sMRI and fMRI dataset. fMRI dataset given is time-series. Since, I am new to this environment, my codes are raw and more like practice code for using ML approaches.
